# Milestone Project 1
****************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Weclome to my first project! 
------------------------------------
I am required to build a static front-end website to showcase what I've learned so far.
I am using HTML and CSS to build this website and Bootstrap 4 which is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, mobile-first websites.
 For this project I've chosen to make an alternative website or fansite for Australian pop/rock band 5 Seconds Of Summer. My aim is to keep layout simple, navigation easy to fallow, use clear calls to action, and use catching colours. 
Bands current website doesn’t do them a justice, landing page isn’t aesthetically pleasing and doesn’t encourage look further, unless you are already an established fan.


#UX
****************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Main objective of this project is to create a website, that is easy to navigate with simple yet streamline page setup. Website that is responsive on different screen sizes. Basically no
It’s important to have a user-friendly website, for new and existing fans of the band being able to download new songs, buy a tickets and merchandise, after all website is one of the foundational elements of marketing strategy. In this case website serves as a meet and greet, pathway to band’s social accounts and their shop and news.

###User Stories
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User stories:

+	As a fan of the 5SOS, I want to be able to buy band's merchendise. 
+	As a fan of 5SOS, I want to be able to buy tickets to their concerts.
+	As an event organiser, I want to be able to reach out to bands representatives to book them for a private gig.
+	As a fan of the 5SOS, I want to listen to band’s music and be able to buy songs, albums right there and then.
+	As a new visitor to the website, I want to be able look up info about the band on my mobile, while not at my desktop.
+	AS a new visitor to the website, I want to find out more about this band.

###Wireframes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To establish the basic structure of a page before visual design and content is added, I used Wireframe.cc.

Here are the links to desktop and mobile view:

#Features
****************************************************************************************************************************************************************

I felt like my new website needed 6 pages to be transparent and easy to use. All of the pages have the same navigation header and bands social links in the footer.
1.Home page- features short introduction to the band and carousel of bands photos.
2.Boys page- again short info about each member of the band and their photo. I've used Bootstrap cards for this purpose.
3.Music page- has few audio files.
4.Video page-has few music videos.
5.Store page-I used original 5SOS store background and linked it up with the "real"
6.Contact page- I've used Bootstrap Form to create a form that anyone can fill in and send it to band.
Although it's possible to fill the form in, it wouldn't send any information entered to the band, because it's not wired up,it's not functional.

#Future features
****************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Although, there are 5SOS social links featured of the bottom of every page, to make things more interesting this website would benefit from:
*Personal social accounts of each band member (probably in "BOYS" page) ,next to their photo.
*More photos added to the "HOME" page carousel.
*

*[AWS Educate](https://www.awseducate.com/student/s/) this is the editor I've used to code,provided by Code Institute.
*[W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input)
*[Hover.css](https://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/)
*[Wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc/pro/login.php) I used this tool to create a visual representation of a user interface,before anys tyling and design is added. 
*[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) Icons from this website compliments the social links for the boyband.

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project.


For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
