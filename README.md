# Milestone Project 1
****************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Weclome to my first project! 
------------------------------------
I am required to build a static front-end website to showcase what I've learned so far.
I am using HTML and CSS to build this website and Bootstrap 4 which is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, mobile-first websites.
 For this project I've chosen to make an alternative website or fansite for Australian pop/rock band 5 Seconds Of Summer. My aim is to keep layout simple, navigation easy to fallow, use clear calls to action, and use catching colours. 
Bands current website doesn’t do them a justice, landing page isn’t aesthetically pleasing and doesn’t encourage look further, unless you are already an established fan.


# UX
****************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Main objective of this project is to create a website, that is easy to navigate with simple yet streamline page setup. Website that is responsive on different screen sizes. Basically no
It’s important to have a user-friendly website, for new and existing fans of the band being able to download new songs, buy a tickets and merchandise, after all website is one of the foundational elements of marketing strategy. In this case website serves as a meet and greet, pathway to band’s social accounts and their shop and news.

### User Stories

### Wireframes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To establish the basic structure of a page before visual design and content is added, I used Wireframe.cc.

Here are the links to desktop and mobile view:

# Features
****************************************************************************************************************************************************************

I felt like my new website needed 6 pages to be transparent and easy to use. All of the pages have the same navigation header and bands social links in the footer.
1. Home page- features short introduction to the band and carousel of bands photos.
2.Boys page- again short info about each member of the band and their photo. I've used Bootstrap cards for this purpose.
3.Music page- has a few audio files.
4.Video page-has a few music videos.
5.Store page-I used original 5SOS store background and linked it up with the "real"
6.Contact page- I've used Bootstrap Form to create a form that anyone can fill in and send it to band.
Although it's possible to fill the form in, it wouldn't send any information entered to the band, because it's not wired up,it's not functional.

# Future features
****************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Although, there are 5SOS social links featured of the bottom of every page, to make things more interesting this website would benefit from:
* Personal social accounts of each band member (probably in "BOYS" page) ,next to their photo.
*More photos added to the "HOME" page carousel.
