All of the pages have the same navigation header and bands social links in the footer.\n* Home page- features short introduction to the band and carousel of bands photos.\n* Boys page- again short info about each member of the band and their photo. I've used Bootstrap cards for this purpose.\n* Music page- has a few audio files.\n* Video page-has a few music videos.\n* Store page-I used original 5SOS store background and linked it up with the \"real\"\n* Contact page- I've used Bootstrap Form to create a form that anyone can fill in and send it to band.\nAlthough it's possible to fill the form in, it wouldn't send any information entered to the band, because it's not wired up,it's not functional.\n\n**An update**\n\nAfter going through reviews and suggestions I've redesigned my layout and now my website is single page scrollable website.\nI added some changes to suit this kind of layout.\n\n+ Some content is hiddden when watching in mobile view, for example song artwork (image).\n+ I added box-shadow class to audio section images to make them stand out a bit and not being so flat.\n+ Jumbotron has been remover and added  as \"carousel-caption\"\n\n\n# Future features\n***************************************************************************************************************************************\nAlthough, there are 5SOS social links featured of the bottom of page, to make things more interesting this website would benefit from:\n* Personal social accounts of each band member (probably in \"BOYS\" page) ,next to their photo.\n* More photos added to the \"HOME\" page carousel.\n* Find the audio player setting that stops previous song ,when the other one is selected.\n* Validate form in CONTACT page\n\n# Technologies Used\n***************************************************************************************************************************************\n \n* HTML\n* CSS\n* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) I've used various components to help me add style and structure to website, e.g. carousel,cards,button, jumbotron,navbar.\n* [Hover.css](https://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/)\n* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) Icons from this website compliments the social links for the boyband.\n* [GoogleFonts](https://fonts.google.com/) I imported the font style (Permanent Marker) from this extensive font catalog.\n* \n\n# Testing\n***************************************************************************************************************************************\n\n+ I've opened my website link(from GitHub pages) on other laptop to check the look and responsivness and it looked better then on  my own laptop. \n\n+ I've worked with Google Chrome as my default browser.\n\n+ And I appreaciate the **DevTools** it provided-one of the best features for me is the option of viewing the appearence of the website on diffrent screensizes,\nwhich saves the time to copy the link and open it on different gadgets-mobile, tablet, or desktop every time I make some changes.\n\n+ Carousel photos didn't line up nicely in Edge To fix this problem I resized the photos,but I am aware that there is another way how to fix the poor alignment with stylesheet.\n+ I also tested the look and functionality in Firefox browser and everything appears to work there.\n+ Mainly I used Git locally for every day checks and tweaks.\n+ I ran my documents through **W3C Validator** for automatic syntax check, to see if there is no unnecessary code and discrepancies.\n\n\n+ Carousel photos didn't line up nicely in Edge To fix this

pages.\nI fixed that, but it helped to have fresh set of eyes to notice that.\n\n\n\n\n### Release notes\n\n + Audio files are not playing in Opera browser, and what I gathered from Opera forum that Opera only play (HTML5) .ogg files, not mp3. \nI could convert .mp3 files to .ogg files, but at this stage I wouldn't know how to make this work, when different browsers use different types of audio.\n\n\n\n#### Going through user stories\n\n* I checked that any visitor to this website can buy the tickets and merchendise by pressing the online store button in STORE page, \n it opens 5SOS official store website in different browser tab.\n\n* If website visitor wishes to fill in the form to send a message or inquire about something, then it can be done, unfortunalely I havn't learned that in my course yet.\nSo the form is there and can be filled in, but it's not functional.This is something that can be improved in the future.\n\n* By pressing the social link icons visitor can see and fallow the band on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube.\n* I didn't add more social platforms to avoid crammed and overwhelming feeling.\n* Website visitor can listen to audio files and watch YouTube embeded videos of the 5SOS. Youtube doesn't open in different browser tab,\n which is usefull to keep a visitor \"occupied\" in this website, rather than get lost in the world of YouTube. Other positive of using YouTube is that visitor can find more 5SOS  videos without leaving the website.\n\n### Bugs \n\nSome of the Font Awesome icons wouldn't display at all, so I refrained from using them. \n\n\n# Deployment\n************************************************************************************************************************************\n\nI created this website using **AWS Educate Cloud9**\nTo deploy this website I used **GitHub** which offers free web hosting and it's easy to set up.\nAfter my code was pushed to *GitHub* repository it was ready to be deployed.\nTo deploy my website I did fallowing:\n+ Login to my GitHub accounts\n+ Choose sun5lower/Milestone-1-5SOS repository\n+ Go to **Settings**\n+ There choose **GitHub Pages**\n+ Select **Master** branch \n+ Deployed website link is displayed in **GitHub Pages** section\n \n [Click here to see website](https://sun5lower.github.io/Milestone-1-5SOS/)\n \nTo run this code locally press this link \n+ This will navigate to the main page of the repository.\n+ Press **Clone or download**\n+ Repository can be cloned using HTTPS or SSH key,so choose one of them and press copy\n+ Open **Git Bash**\n+ Choose the desired directory\n+ Type ```git clone``` and then paste the URL you copied earlier\n\n\n ```$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY```\n\n[Click here to see my repository](https://github.com/sun5lower/Milestone-1-5SOS)\n\n# Credits\n***************************************************************************************************************************************\n#### In this project I've used:\n\n\n* [AWS Educate](https://www.awseducate.com/student/s/) this is the editor I've used to code,provided by Code Institute.\n* [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input)\n* [Wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc/pro/login.php) I used this tool to create a visual representation of a user interface,before any styling and design is added. \n* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp) This website helped me understand how to use certain code to achieve  \n* [GitHub](https://github.com/) Used to deploy my project\n* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) Video files are embeded from YouTube.\n* [W3Newbie](https://w3newbie.com/courses/) Help to understand how to implement certain components, with online tutorial.\n* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) Using forums to find out how to make all the photos the same size.\n* [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/) Reading chats on requiroments and mistakes,asking for advise.\n* [htmlcolorcodes](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/) I used this website to find right colors for my project-background color, font color etc. \n\n\n### Media\n\nThe photos used in this site were obtained from:\n\n* [Modest Management](modestmanagement.com)\n* [Fanpop](fr.fanpop.com)\n* [Pressfrom](Pressfrom.com) by Chris Pizzello \n* [5SOS official website](5SOS.com) -
